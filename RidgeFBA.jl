"""
RidgeFBA optimizes the desired objective function while minimizing L2 norm of the flux vector
The flux vector computed by RidgeFBA is more consistent with the actual values


# INPUTS

- metabolic model:  Metabolic models contain sotoichiometric matrix  and also other informations such as flux boundaries 
                    and Gene-Protein-Reaction rules. They can be found in different formats including .xml.
                    Metabolic models can be downloaded from [BiGG Models](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/) or elsewhere.

- lambda:           Regularization coefficient for the L2 norm term in the objective function of the optimization problem.
                    The larger lambda, the smaller the flux vector.

- c:                A vector with the same length as the metabolic model reactions, determining the objective function.
                    For example, if biomass is meant to be the objective function, the corresponding element in c vector
                    is set to 1 and the others are zero. 
 

# OUTPUTS

- flux_vector:      It is the calculated flux distribution, which is of type Vector{Float64}
                    (a vector whose elements are Float64), So this can be indexed and used like any other vector. 


# EXAMPLES

flux_vector=RidgeFBA(ecoli_metabolic_model,c_test,10^-5)
